# Project Name

## Description

This project is a robust web application designed to streamline user management processes using FastAPI, Celery, and Prisma. It leverages asynchronous programming to handle user data efficiently and is backed by a Redis broker for task management.

### Why This Project?

The motivation behind this project was to create a scalable and efficient system for handling user data and processes asynchronously. This approach helps in managing large volumes of requests without blocking the server, improving the overall performance and user experience.

### Challenges and Future Features

- **Challenges**: Integrating Celery with FastAPI and ensuring that the asynchronous tasks are handled properly was a significant challenge due to the nature of async programming and task management.
- **Future Features**: Plans to implement more advanced user management features, such as multi-factor authentication and real-time data updates using WebSockets.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: FastAPI
- **Task Queue**: Celery
- **Database**: Prisma Client Python with PostgreSQL
- **Broker**: Redis

## Installation

To get this project running locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://yourrepository.git
   cd your-project-folder
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `.venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and populate it with the necessary environment variables:
   ```
   REDIS_HOST=localhost
   REDIS_PORT=6379
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/mydatabase
   ```

5. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

6. **Start Celery worker**
   ```bash
   celery -A commons.celery.celery_app worker --loglevel=info
   ```

## Usage

After installation, you can create and manage users through the API endpoints provided by FastAPI. Visit `http://localhost:8000/docs` for the Swagger UI to interact with the API.
